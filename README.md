## üöÄ How I Used AI

I used **ChatGPT** during the development process to:

- **Generate mock data** for doctor profiles and availability
- **Improve accessibility** by suggesting proper ARIA attributes and semantic HTML usage
- **Debug logic** and identify cleaner code patterns
- **Boost productivity**, allowing me to focus more on logic and UI/UX instead of repetitive boilerplate

AI tools allowed me to **work smarter, not harder**, showcasing how I can deliver high-quality results efficiently.
